# project cross-will

Hi! This is the project of the endless intersections of my will and ...

- my degree in data science will, 
- my teachers will,
- my family will, 
- my friends will,
- my coworker will,
- my girlfriend will,
- ...

It wouldn't be smart to share true priority orders right now (lol), but if all of these science would bring us somewhere then the order would naturally/probabilistically unfold, I guess.

🤸‍♂️ So I'm in the process of making my thesis for my Master Degree in Data Science. 
🌱 I'm working to build a language model from scratch to the deployment.
🤖 Sharing my mistakes and thoughts.
⭐️ Looking to appreciate what the Natural Language Processing will move us towards.
